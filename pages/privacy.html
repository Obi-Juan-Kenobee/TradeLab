                <h2>Public information on our site</h2>
                <h3>Public Profile</h3>
                <p>Upon creating an account with us, all your information by default is set to private. Meaning no one
                    else have access to view your information. You can decide to share trade(s) with the public if you
                    wish. Upon doing so, anyone could access the trade(s) you decide to share.</p>
                <p>You are in control to decide which data points if any, you would like to share. For example, you can
                    decide to share your profit and loss or just your return %. You can control this under your privacy
                    settings.</p>
                <h3>Public Content</h3>
                <p>Our services allow those with registered user account to share trades with the rest of the internet
                    via our sharing feature.</p>
                <p>By using our sharing features, you grant irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty free license to publish
                    and disclose the content, as well as the username of the author, which makes you identifiable.</p>
                <h2>Security of personal data</h2>
                <p>We use technical and organization procedures to protect your personal data and required third party
                    with who we work to do the dame.</p>
                <p>We use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology in order to protect certain information
                    that you submit to us. This technology protects you from having your information intercepted by
                    anyone while it is being transmitted to TraderSync or payment processor. While on a secure page,
                    such as our order form, the “lock” icon in the browser window is displayed, confirming that a secure
                    and encrypted connection has been established with the Website. We work hard to ensure that our
                    Service is secure and that we meet industry standards. We also use other safeguards, such as
                    firewalls, authentication systems (i.e. passwords, and personal identification numbers), and access
                    control mechanisms to control unauthorized access to systems and data. If you have chosen to create
                    an account, you are responsible for doing everything you reasonably can to keep your access details
                    secret. You must not share these details with anyone else.</p>
                <p>We also do our best to protect user information offline. All of our users’ personal information is
                    restricted to our offices. Only employees who need to see the information to perform their jobs are
                    allowed to access it.</p>
                <p>The servers that store personal data are located in a secure environment in a locked facility.</p>
                <p>We are constantly improving the ways we secure, store, and process the data we collect, including the
                    addition of physical security measures that help us counter unauthorized access to our systems.
                    However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot
                    guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                <h2>Children and sensitive personal data</h2>
                <p>This website and mobile apps are not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly
