              subscription in the future. This subscription credit may not be

              As discussed with Stephen, it is odd to include this in a
              public-facing terms and conditions. It would usually be included
              in an internal policy and reinforced with employee training. Note
              that adding it here might lead some to ask whether you should be
              restricting the ability of third-party service providers to post
              and comment as well, but I am assuming you are not doing so and do
              not have any intention of doing so. Please let me know if this
              assumption in incorrect.

        <p>
          Trading futures and forex involves significant risk and may not be
          suitable for all investors. There is a possibility of losing all or
          more than the initial investment. It is important to use risk capital,
          which is money that can be lost without affecting one’s financial
          security or lifestyle. Only individuals with sufficient risk capital
          should consider trading. Past performance is not indicative of future
          results.

                      Hypothetical performance results have inherent
                      limitations, some of which are outlined below. No
                      assurance is given that any account will or is likely to
                      achieve similar profits or losses as shown in hypothetical
                      performance results. There can be significant differences
                      between hypothetical performance results and actual
                      trading outcomes. Hypothetical results are typically
                      prepared with the benefit of hindsight and do not involve
                      financial risk. They cannot fully account for the impact
                      of financial risk in actual trading. Factors such as the
                      ability to withstand losses or adhere to a specific
                      trading program can affect actual trading results.
                      Additionally, there are numerous other market-related
                      factors to consider.

        <p class="sub-titles"><strong>Subscriptions</strong></p>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
          (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or
          TraderSync. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal
          either through your online account management page or by contacting
          TraderSync. customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required
          to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide
          TraderSync. with accurate and complete billing information including
          full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
          payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
          you automatically authorize TraderSync. to charge all Subscription
          fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, TraderSync.
          will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
          manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
          corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-titles"><strong>Free Trial</strong></p>
        <p>
          TraderSync. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a
          free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time and without notice, TraderSync. reserves the right to (i)
          modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
          cancel such Free Trial offer.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-titles"><strong>Fee Changes</strong></p>
        <p>
          TraderSync., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
          will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          TraderSync. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
          your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
          comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
          Subscription fee amount.
